    <p><strong>What’s the data of happiness?</strong></p>
    <p>Data scientists and researchers are working on extracting patterns, quantifying happiness by giving scores and analyzing reasons. For example, World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The World Happiness Report 2020 for the first time ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban, and natural environments combine to affect our happiness. There are also researches about the correlation between happiness and life satisfaction by looking into the happiness overtime, Differences in happiness within countries, etc. These are all well-designed researches.</p>

<p>But that's not the direction we take here.</p>
    <p><strong>How would you describe happiness?</strong></p>
    <p>You might think of people - friends, family, partner... Or things - got an A from class, getting praise, or kindness from a stranger … These are concrete details that might directly recall the memory of happiness. Here, instead of showing you the abstract numbers, this data visualization brings you to the moment of happiness and allows you to explore among different happy moments and feel it through exploration. And if you want to know more about the dataset and process, there are also some details for you to look at.</p>
    <p>Please enjoy :)</p>
