  <h1>Stories Behind the Happy Moment and Dataset</h1>
  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>How do you feel about the exploration? The exploration page randomly shows 2000 out of 100,000 happy moments and you can explore it using filter, age selection, etc. If you’re interested in the story behind, here is the place for you.</p>
    <p>&#10071;The page may take some time to load:)</p>

    <p>What made you happy over the past 24h/3months?</p>

    <p>Over 10,000 people documented their 100,000 happy moments and made this wonderful dataset called happyDB. Each datapoint contains is basically a message about happy moment,  a predicted category, and some basic demographic information related to the person(just for academic analysis use).</p>

    <p>
Therefore, my design for the visualization of this data is also mainly based on the category, the individuals, and the message(text) itself.</p>
    <h2>Category</h2>
    <p>
The categories of the happy moments are predicted by some NLP tools based on several rounds of calculations and classifications. The estimations are rough, but in my scans, they appear to be a decent baseline and are interesting enough to look at more closely.</p>

    <div class="subtitle">
      <h3>Category count for different predicted category</h3>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div id="visualization">
    <div class="svg-container1">

    </div>
    <p class='explanation'>Affection and achievement are listed as the top2, which is close to our own experience.</p>

    <div class="text1">

      <h2>Subject</h2>

      <p>Apparently, most of the happy moments are about “I” or “we”, but in addition to that, other subjects involved in this moment are also worth looking at.</p>
      <p>I especially like the "someone" moment.</p>


      <div class="subtitle">
        <h3>Subject count for some keywords</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="svg-container2">

    </div>
    <!-- <p class='explanation'>Most</p> -->

    <div class="text1">


      <h2>Text</h2>
        <p>The researchers built this corpus with the goal to understand the causes of happiness and how can techniques like NLP contribute to positive psychology. But since there is enough pattern analysis, in this experience I also want the audience to fully immerse in the text and feel the power of the text itself. Here is a full version of the keyword filter.</p>
      <div class="subtitle">
        <h3>Check raw messgaes for some keywords</h3>
