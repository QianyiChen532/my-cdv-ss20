## Dataset

### Topic 1: Cat & Dogs in COVID-19
dataset:
[PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/search/cats-for-adoption/gu/piti-municipality/)
[Cat Breeds Dataset(for adoption)](https://www.kaggle.com/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset#cats.csv)
[Dogs Adopted](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dog-shelters)

All of these three are related to the API of PetFinder. I am inspired by the news about stray dogs and cats during this COVID-19 and want to visualize the need.

### Topic 2: Social Interaction
[Good relationship](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/good-relationtips-most-commonly-given-relationship-advice/)
This dataset provides a web scrape of data about articles giving advice on how to maintain good relationship.

[Confidence](https://osf.io/s46pr/)
The Confidence Database is aggregating data from behavioral studies that have asked participantsâ€™ how confident they were in their own assessments. As of its launch earlier this month, the database contains 145 datasets, 8,700 participants, and 4 million individual observations. [h/t Audrey Mazancieux + Doby Rahnev]

### Topic 3: Web Scrape data on Weibo(TBD)
My current wild thoughts for this one is to scrape weibo data around the topic of anxiety for college students(in terms of graduation, job, etc).The inspiration comes from this [visualization](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_4315606) (in mandarin) .
For this idea, I guess both the restriction on API and semantic analysis will bring difficulties. But I'll be super excited if I can make it.
