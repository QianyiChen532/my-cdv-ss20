## Response to "The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism” - Shoshana Zuboff

“Surveillance capitalism”, from what I’ve heard from Zuboff’s talk, refers to the ideology behind the phenomenon that big tech companies are making profits by rendering user’s behavioral data and give it to services providers. What they’re selling is not only their predictive power, but also the raw materials they get from user’s behavior without informing them.

The main point Zuboff criticizes is the asymmetric relationship between users and the companies behind the platforms. She doesn’t even think the concept of “user” is appropriate since we are actually the “raw data” used by the companies. This is one of the impressive argument I heard from her. While topics like data privacy are easily be concluded to backlash to the evil tech giants, what sparks me is her way of analyzing from the capitalist’s perspective. It’s not only people’s passive attitude toward the fight with big companies but also capitalists’ strategies that designed to deprive the power of people to say ’no’. All the surveillance is integrated into an ecosystem that is so closely related with our daily life that we just can’t leave without them. That truly resonates my experience when using Alipay and WeChat. Especially when Alipay takes its rapid move towards an integrated service provider, or a connection between the user and everything in life including health, insurance, traffic, consumption, etc, all of the conveniences it provides are based on our consent to give out our data. And that’s a start of a negative feedback loop - there is only “never or infinite times”, namely once the users get used to giving out data, it might be hard for them to change the mindset, especially at the cost of not using the services. I understand the awareness raising purpose of this book, but I am a little suspicious about the ultimate profound impact it can have on turning the conceptual changes into real actions. When you tell the idea of surveillance capitalism to a person, he/she is very like to be impressed, but would that result in making this person not using Google or Alipay any more?
