## Notes

- Styling is in essence in CSS, so I can either do it in CSS (through class), or using .style() to edit. (Like what we do in js)
- When append group: append g first, then create the shapes(rect, circle, etc).
- Math.random return value in (0,1), need to scale the output.
- Found a way to access a specific topic name instead of 'selectAll' :D
- Among the transformation of groups, I mainly used 'translate' for now.
