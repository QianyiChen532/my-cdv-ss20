## Two articles that tell a story with data and data visualization

(The Bloomberg Years: Reshaping New York (NYT))[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/08/18/reshaping-new-york/index.html]

I learned this one from a class I took last semester in ITP. Although this is an early NYT article, the way of presenting data is very innovative even among today’s visualization works. This article visualized the accomplishments of Bloomberg as the mayor of NY including the new building constructed during that year, the rezoned areas in the city, the urban planning of bike lanes, etc. It incorporates both the photos and models. The photos are taken at the same location at different times, which presents a clear comparison of changes happening during this period. While the 3d models simplify the general distribution of the buildings and highlight the changes using color, providing a straightforward illustration for the changes. The combination of both abstract and realistic ways works very well in visualizing the changes in the city.
 
(The Birthday Paradox)[https://pudding.cool/2018/04/birthday-paradox/]
This article explain the process of the birthday paradox(the math about how many people do we need in a room to have a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday) using simple illustration and cute animation. The animation simulated a dynamic process as the number of people in a room increase, and the graph above shows corresponding datapoint.
